    <h1><a href="/">Account Migration Tool</a></h1>
    
    <div class="section" id="top">
        <p> This page is to help you decide if you want to use this migration tool to move your ATProto (Bluesky) account to a new
            PDS.
            One way or the other. TLDR (You should still read the whole thing), at least read and follow the <a
                    href="#precautions">precautions section</a>.</p>


        <section class="section" style="text-align:left">
            <h2>Info</h2>
            <p>This is a no frills PDS account migration tool. Meaning you will find few bells and whistles to
                simplify the process and hopefully allow more successful account migrations for most users. The creator
                or host of this tool will not be able to help you recover your account if something goes wrong. So be
                advised you and your PDS admin may be on your own besides helpful answers and understand the risk you
                take in doing an account movement. The tool has been tested, and it has worked well, but it is still
                important to understand this. If you follow <a
                        href="#precautions">precautions section</a> this will also greatly increase the odds of
                recovering from any issues. You will still need to have some know how, but it is very possible with a
                backup rotation key and backup of your account. I also recommend trying out an alt before you do your
                main account so you know what to expect.</p>

        <section id="precautions" class="section" style="text-align:left">
            <h2>Precautions</h2>
            <p>Before you even run the migration tool I STRONGLY suggest you add a rotation key and have a back up of your repo
                and blobs. With both of these you are not guarantee a full recovery if something goes wrong. But it will
                greatly increase your odds.</p>
            <h3>Rotation Key Backup</h3>
            <p>I recommend using <a href="https://atpairport.com/ticket-booth">atpairport.com</a> to add a new rotation
                key to your PLC. or you can follow <a href="https://whtwnd.com/bnewbold.net/3lj7jmt2ct72r">this blog
                    post</a> to do it with goat. This migration tool will not use this rotation key at this time, but if
                something happens, it helps to have this in the meantime.
            <p>
            <h3>Repo & Blob backup</h3>

            <p>I also recommend taking a back up of your account with <a href="https://boat.kelinci.net/">boat</a>. You
                want to <a href="https://boat.kelinci.net/repo-export">"Export repository"</a> and <a
                        href="https://boat.kelinci.net/blob-export">"Export
                    blobs"</a>. Both just take your
                current handle and download those exports to your computer. These are your posts, pictures, and videos.

        <section id="cant-login" class="section" style="text-align:left">
            <h2>I can't log in?/Says my account is deactivated?</h2>
            <p>When you move to a non Bluesky PDS you have to do an extra step on login.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>On the Sign in screen for <a href="https://bsky.app">bsky.app</a> or on the app click the top input
                    titled "Hosting provider" and has a globe icon and says Bluesky Social"
                </li>
                <li>Click the tab labeled custom</li>
                <li>In the input for server address you put the same URL you used for the new PDS URL with the https://
                    like so <code>https://example.com</code></li>
                <li>Click done and enter your new handle(or email) and password</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="invalid-handle" class="section" style="text-align:left">
            <h2>My account says Invalid Handle?</h2>
            <p>It's a bit of a bug sometimes. I'm not sure what causes it, but usually mentioning your handle in a post
                or reply fixes it.
                Like <code>@fullhandle.newpds.com</code>, may or may not highlight it blue and autofill it but make sure
                you have the
                full handle and the @ like that. Can also check your handle with the <a
                        href="https://bsky-debug.app/handle">Bluesky Debug Page</a>. If you see green, and it says one
                of
                them pass you should be fine and just may take a while to update.</p>

        <section id="help" class="section" style="text-align:left">
            <h2>!!!!!HELP!!!!!</h2>
            <p>If you're having issues with the migration tool first of all, I'm very sorry. I have tested this to the best of
                my
                ability, but PDS migrations do come with risks. I would recommend getting with the owner of the PDS and
                seeing where the account stands with tools like <a href="https://pdsls.dev">pdsls</a>.</p>

            <p> The tool is designed to be able to be re ran IF you set the Advance Options flags.For example, lets say
                if it created the account, repo is there but some blobs are missing. You can uncheck everything but
                "Migrate Missing Blobs", "Migrate Prefs", and "Migrate PLC record" and it will pick up after the account
                repo migration. It is odd in the fact that all the fields are required. That's just to cut down on logic
                to hopefully cut down on bugs. If you don't ever see the "Please enter your PLC Token" and enter the
                token sent to your email, you can just
                forget about it and call it a day if it's too much. Your old account is still active and working.</p>
        </section>


        <section id="why" class="section" style="text-align:left">
            <h2>Why doesn't this tool have xyz?</h2>
            <p>This migration tool was designed to pretty much be the goat account migration with a UI. Like in this <a
                    href="https://whtwnd.com/bnewbold.net/3l5ii332pf32u"> post</a>. Keeping it simple and hard fails if
                anything
                goes wrong
                to
                hopefully cover most use cases. Rule of thumb if reading the goat migration blog post makes you nervous,
                you may not want to move to a new PDS with this tool till it has been battle tested.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="done" class="section" style="text-align:left">
            <h2>Alright account migrated, now what?</h2>
            <p>Welcome to your new PDS! I recommend now re running the steps in <a
                    href="#precautions">precautions section</a> along with keeping regular backups of your account. With
                the rotation key and backups you can almost always recover even if your new PDS disappears overnight. It
                may take a bit of know how, but it is very possible.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="slow" class="section" style="text-align:left">
            <h2>Why is it so SLOW?</h2>
            <p>Everything happens client side, and the blob uploads take a while. Nothing runs in parallel. Blob uploads
                happen one at a time; once one is done, the next goes. This is done just to keep it as simple as
                possible and to hopefully limit the chance of failures on uploads. My personal account takes about
                20-30ish mins to move with 1,700ish blobs at 800mb on a 1gig internet connection.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="open-source" class="section" style="text-align:left">
            <h2>Can I check out the code anywhere?</h2>
            <p>Yep! This migration tool is based on the open source pds-moover project. You can find the original code on <a
                    href="https://tangled.sh/@baileytownsend.dev/pds-moover">tangled.sh</a>. Also, if you're a
                developer,
                and you want to fork the code for a new UI, the migration logic is all in one js file. Just take it and
                its dependencies and have at it.</p>
